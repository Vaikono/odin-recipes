    <P>According to Wikipedia, A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped 
        or batter-dipped ham and cheese sandwich that is pan or deep fried. 
        It is a variation of the French croque monsieur. From the 1930s to 
        the 1960s, American cookbooks had recipes under such names as 
        "French sandwich", "toasted ham sandwich", and "French toasted cheese sandwich".
